    <h2>Section one</h2>
    <p>Nature is an important and integral part of mankind.
       It is one of the greatest blessings for human life; 
       however, nowadays humans fail to recognize it as one. 
       Nature has been an inspiration for numerous poets, 
       writers, artists and more of yesteryears. 
       This remarkable creation inspired them to write poems 
       and stories in the glory of it. They truly valued 
       nature which reflects in their works even today. 
       Essentially, nature is everything we are surrounded by 
       like the water we drink, the air we breathe, the sun we 
       soak in, the birds we hear chirping, the moon we gaze at 
       and more. Above all, it is rich and vibrant and consists 
       of both living and non-living things. Therefore, people 
       of the modern age should also learn something from people 
       of yesteryear and start valuing nature before it gets too 
       late.</p>
